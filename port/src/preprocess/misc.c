/**
 * The ROM's mpconfigs segment, left as it is.
 *
 * This used to walk the segment as an array of struct mpconfig and byte-swap
 * each record's fields. It cannot: a record in the ROM is 104 bytes and this
 * build's struct is larger (the setup grew a longer name, and storedbotbits
 * is port-only), so every record after the first was swapped at offsets that
 * are not its fields - writing into the ROM image, or into a mod's own
 * segs/mpconfigs where one replaced it - and the last records of the 44 were
 * not reached at all.
 *
 * Nothing reads the segment. The game's 44 configs are g_MpConfigs in
 * src/game/mpconfigs.c, in this build's own layout, and challengeLoadConfig()
 * takes each one from there. Converting the segment properly would mean a
 * struct for the ROM's layout, for data with no reader.
