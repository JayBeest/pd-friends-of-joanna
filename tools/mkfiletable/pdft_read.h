/**
 * PDFT decoder — the other half of pdft_write.c.
 *
 * Bytes in, structs out, no file I/O and no policy, for the same reason the
 * encoder has none. The layout it accepts is the layout pdft_write.c emits and
 * romdataParseFileTable() (port/src/romdata.c) reads; if the three ever
 * disagree, the engine is right and these two are wrong.
 *
 * Strings point into the caller's buffer rather than being copied, so the
 * buffer has to outlive the table. pdftFree() releases only the arrays.
